# 2D-Pool-Game
Repository for my "2D Pool Game" Project for my "Computer Graphics" course at Rowan University. The program is written in HTML and JavaScript, and was coded using VS Code.

***To run the program, download all of the files into one place and then double-click on the HTML file. The program runs in Google Chrome.***

To aim your shot, just left-click and hold on the mouse, and then move the mouse around. A white line will appear. When you let go, the cue ball will move in the direction opposite of which you pulled the mouse back from. The longer the white line, the more power the cue ball will be hit with.
